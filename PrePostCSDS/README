Download data from figshare and place it in the same folder as the .m files.

Fig2_FP.mat contains structs that are have fields organized in rows of mice by mouse number, which is indicated in the field "mouse" or "mice." 
The rest of the fields contain matrices of neural data aligned to entry into the social zone (with the social target indicated by the name of the struct eg SWcsds_all_post). 
Each row of the matrix is a mouse, with time along the columns. 
There are separate structs for susceptible and resilient mice and pre- and post-CSDS.

Fig2_imaging.mat is similarly organized with an added level as it contains single cell data. 
Each row of cells is a mouse, and inside the cell is a matrix of neuron x time (aligned to social zone entry).

defeat_LHb_fig_paper.m creates the figure panels from Fig 1, 2, and part of Fig 5. 

supp_fig.m creates the figure panels from Fig S1, and S2. 

You will additionally need to download the code for shadedErrorBar (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-raacampbell-shadederrorbar),
rgb (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24497-rgb-triple-of-color-name-version-2?s_tid=srchtitle) and customcolormap (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69470-custom-colormap). 

For code used to create the datasets, see FP and imaging folders.

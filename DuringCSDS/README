Create python environment to run these jupyter notebooks using paper_conda_requirements.txt.

Download the data from figshare and put it in the same folder as the notebooks. Most data files are dictionaries with each corresponding to a mouse and defeat day. 

Run defeat_analysis_paper.ipynb first. 

defeat_analysis_paper.ipynb creates figure panels from Fig 3-4, Fig S3-6. 

Then run defeat_behavior_durng_opto_paper.ipynb. This creates panels from Fig 5 and Fig S7.
